# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Decision Log

Last updated: {{TODAY}}

> **Purpose:** capture the _why_ behind architectural, product, and tooling decisions so future AI sessions and developers don't have to re-derive them (or undo them).

---

## Format

Each decision is one row. **Locked** decisions are final until a new decision supersedes them. **Deferred** decisions are explicit non-decisions with a trigger for when to revisit.

| # | Date | Status | Topic | Decision | Why | Rejected alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

---

## Locked decisions

_Decisions that are final. If you want to change one of these, write a new decision row that supersedes it — don't silently overwrite._

| # | Date | Topic | Decision | Why | Rejected alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {{TODAY}} | _Example_ | _What was decided_ | _Why this over the alternatives_ | _What was rejected and why_ |

---

## Deferred decisions

_Explicit non-decisions. Each has a trigger for when to revisit._

| # | Date | Topic | Current non-decision | Trigger to revisit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {{TODAY}} | _Example_ | _We're not deciding this yet_ | _When X happens_ |

## How to add a decision

1. Use the highest unused `#`.
2. Fill date, status, topic, decision, why, rejected alternatives.
3. If this supersedes a prior decision, reference it: "Supersedes #N".
4. If it's deferred, include a trigger condition.
5. Commit with message: `Record decision #N: <topic>`.
